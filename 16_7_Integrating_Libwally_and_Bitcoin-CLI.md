# 16.7: Integrate Libwally and Bitcoin-CLI

> **NOTE:** This is a draft in progress, so that I can get some feedback from early reviewers. It is not yet ready for learning.

Libwally is limited. It's about creating and accessing wallets, with some additional functions related to transactions and PSBTs that might be useful for services that are not connected to full nodes on the internet. Ultimately, however, you're going to need full node services to take advantage of Libwally.

This final section will offer some examples of using Libwally programs to complement a `bitcoin-cli` environment. Though these examples imply that these services are all on the same machine, they may become even more powerful if the `bitcoin-cli` service is directly connected to the internet and the Libwally service is not.

## Sharing a Transaction

[ยง16.5: Using Scripts in Libwally](16_5_Using_Scripts_in_Libwally.md) detailed how Libwally could be used to rewrite an existing transaction, to do something that `bitcoin-cli` can't: produce a transaction that contains a unique P2SH. Obviously, this is a building block; if you dig further into Libwally you'll want to create entire transactions on your own. But, this abbreviated methodology also has its own usage: it shows how transactions can be passed back and forth between `bitcoin-cli` and Libwally, demonstrating a first example of using them in a complementary fashion.

We're going to start out with this UTXO:
```
  {
    "txid": "c0a110a7a84399b98052c6545018873b13ee3128fa74f7a697779174a36ea33a",
    "vout": 1,
    "address": "mvLyH7Rs45c16FG2dfV7uuTKV6pL92kWxo",
    "label": "",
    "scriptPubKey": "76a914a2a68c5f9b8e25fdd1213c38d952ab2be2e271be88ac",
    "amount": 0.00094000,
    "confirmations": 17375,
    "spendable": true,
    "solvable": true,
    "desc": "pkh([ce0c7e14/0'/0'/5']0368d0fffa651783524f8b934d24d03b32bf8ff2c0808943a556b3d74b2e5c7d65)#qldtsl65",
    "safe": true
  }
```
By now, you know how to set up a transaction with `bitcoin-cli`:
```
$ utxo_txid=$(bitcoin-cli listunspent | jq -r '.[0] | .txid') 
$ utxo_vout=$(bitcoin-cli listunspent | jq -r '.[0] | .vout')
$ recipient=tb1qycsmq3jas5wkhf8xrfn8k7438cm5pc8h9ae2k0
$ rawtxhex=$(bitcoin-cli -named createrawtransaction inputs='''[ { "txid": "'$utxo_txid'", "vout": '$utxo_vout' } ]''' outputs='''{ "'$recipient'": 0.0009 }''')
```
The output doesn't matter, because that's what we're going to be rewriting.

We also slightly vary our old `replacewithscript` code to take a satoshi argument. A fancier bit of code could read the existing `vout` info before rewriting, but we're keeping things very close to our [original code](src/16_5_replacewithscript.c).
```
...
  int satoshis = atoi(argv[3]);
...
  lw_response = wally_tx_output_init_alloc(satoshis,p2sh,sizeof(p2sh),&tx_output);
...
```
Then we just run things like before:
```
$ newtxhex=$(./replacewithscript $rawtxhex $script 9000)
```
Here's what the original transaction looked like:
```
$ bitcoin-cli decoderawtransaction $rawtxhex
{
  "txid": "438d50edd7abeaf656c5abe856a00a20af5ff08939df8fdb9f8bfbfb96234fcb",
  "hash": "438d50edd7abeaf656c5abe856a00a20af5ff08939df8fdb9f8bfbfb96234fcb",
  "version": 2,
  "size": 82,
  "vsize": 82,
  "weight": 328,
  "locktime": 0,
  "vin": [
    {
      "txid": "c0a110a7a84399b98052c6545018873b13ee3128fa74f7a697779174a36ea33a",
      "vout": 1,
      "scriptSig": {
        "asm": "",
        "hex": ""
      },
      "sequence": 4294967295
    }
  ],
  "vout": [
    {
      "value": 0.00090000,
      "n": 0,
      "scriptPubKey": {
        "asm": "0 2621b0465d851d6ba4e61a667b7ab13e3740e0f7",
        "hex": "00142621b0465d851d6ba4e61a667b7ab13e3740e0f7",
        "reqSigs": 1,
        "type": "witness_v0_keyhash",
        "addresses": [
          "tb1qycsmq3jas5wkhf8xrfn8k7438cm5pc8h9ae2k0"
        ]
      }
    }
  ]
}
```
And here's the transaction rewritten by Libwally to use a P2SH:
```
standup@btctest:~/c$ bitcoin-cli decoderawtransaction $newtxhex
{
  "txid": "badb57622ab5fe029fc1a71ace9f7b76c695f933bceb0d38a155c2e5c984f4e9",
  "hash": "badb57622ab5fe029fc1a71ace9f7b76c695f933bceb0d38a155c2e5c984f4e9",
  "version": 2,
  "size": 83,
  "vsize": 83,
  "weight": 332,
  "locktime": 0,
  "vin": [
    {
      "txid": "c0a110a7a84399b98052c6545018873b13ee3128fa74f7a697779174a36ea33a",
      "vout": 1,
      "scriptSig": {
        "asm": "",
        "hex": ""
      },
      "sequence": 0
    }
  ],
  "vout": [
    {
      "value": 0.00090000,
      "n": 0,
      "scriptPubKey": {
        "asm": "OP_HASH160 3f58b4f7b14847a9083694b9b3b52a4cea2569ed OP_EQUAL",
        "hex": "a9143f58b4f7b14847a9083694b9b3b52a4cea2569ed87",
        "reqSigs": 1,
        "type": "scripthash",
        "addresses": [
          "2My2ApqGcoNXYceZC4d7fipBu4GodkbefHD"
        ]
      }
    }
  ]
}
```
Afterward you can sign it as usual with `bitcoin-cli`:
```
$ signedtx=$(bitcoin-cli signrawtransactionwithwallet $newtxhex | jq -r '.hex')
```
And as you can see, the result is a legitimate transaction ready to go out to the Bitcoin network:
```
$ bitcoin-cli decoderawtransaction $signedtx
{
  "txid": "3061ca8c01d029c0086adbf8b7d4280280c8aee151500bab7c4f783bbc8e75e6",

      },
      "sequence": 0
    }
  ],
  "vout": [
    {
      "value": 0.00090000,
      "n": 0,
      "scriptPubKey": {
        "asm": "OP_HASH160 3f58b4f7b14847a9083694b9b3b52a4cea2569ed OP_EQUAL",
        "hex": "a9143f58b4f7b14847a9083694b9b3b52a4cea2569ed87",
        "reqSigs": 1,
        "type": "scripthash",
        "addresses": [
          "2My2ApqGcoNXYceZC4d7fipBu4GodkbefHD"
        ]
      }
    }
  ]
}
```
Voila! That's the power of Libwally with `bitcoin-cli`.

Obviously, you can also pass around a PSBT using the functions described in [ยง16.4](16_4_Using_PSBTs_in_Libwally.md) and that's a more sustainable methodlogy in the modern-day usage of Bitcoin, but in either example, the methodology of passing transactions from `bitcoin-cli` to Libwally code and back should be similarly.

## Importing & Experting BIP39 Seeds

Unfortunately, not all interactions go as smoothly. For example, it would be nice if you could either export an HD seed from `bitcoin-cli`, to generate the mnemonic phrase with Libwally, or to generate a seed from a mneomnic phrase on Libwally, and then import it into `bitcoin-cli`. Unfortunately, neither of these is possible at this time. A mneomnic phrase is translated into a seed using HMAC-SHA512, which means the result is 512 bits. However, `bitcoin-cli` exports HD seeds (using `dumpwallet`) and imports HD seeds (using `sethdseed`) with a length of 256 bits. Until that is changed, never the twain shall meet (and when that does change, there will be another notable improvement in the integration between `bitcoin-cli` and Libwally).

> :book: ***What's the Difference Between Entropy & a Seed?*** Libwally says that it creates its mnemonic phrases from entropy. That's essentially the same thing as a seed: they're both large, randomized numbers. So, if `bitcoin-cli` was compatible with 512-bit mnemonic-phrase seeds, you could use one to generate the mneomnic phrases, and get the results that you'd expect.

> :book: ***What's the difference between Entropy & Raw Entropy?*** Not all entropy is the same. When you input entropy into a command that creates a mnemonic seed, it has to a specific, well-understand length. Changing raw entropy into entropy requires massaging the raw entropy until it's the right length and format, and at that point you could reuse that (non-raw) entropy to always recreate the same mnemonics (which is why it's effectively the same thing as a seed at that point, but raw entropy isn't).

[This is backburnered for the moment]

## Creating Recovery Words

One of the big limitations of Bitcoin Core is that it creates a BIP32 HD wallet, but it doesn't provide any way to back that up with BIP39 mnemonic words. With Libwally, you can now do that yourself.

You can dump your wallet with the `dumpwallet` RPC command:
```
$ bitcoin-cli dumpwallet seed
{
  "filename": "/home/standup/.bitcoin/seed"
}
```
If you read the file you created, you should see your seed with the line `hdseed=1`
```
standup@btctest:~/.bitcoin$ more seed | grep hdseed
cV2ofwMK2EWH7PduPGTU3mKkKsQRhAddWNzMLHqVgnvD8RgkHE97 2020-08-04T19:04:02Z hdseed=1 # addr=tb1qtuk0khv6qmwq6xl0llk9r8ht35z3kkk6qsaazw
```

The following command will currently work to extract that seed, though this type of command depending on file formatting is always prone to breaking as file formats change:
```
seed=$(cat seed | grep hdseed=1 | awk '{print $1}')
```
Now, you just need to import that into a simple Libwally program.

[write the libwally program]
   * bip32_key_serialize
   * bip39_mnemonic_from_bytes
[write a script that (1) dumps; (2) extracts the key; (3) runs it through libwally; (4) outputs the mnemonic words]
