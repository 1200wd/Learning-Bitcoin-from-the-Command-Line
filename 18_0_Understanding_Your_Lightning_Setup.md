# Chapter 18: Understanding Your Lighting Setup

> :information_source: **NOTE:** This is a draft in progress, so that I can get some feedback from early reviewers. It is not yet ready for learning.

The previous chapter concluded our work with Bitcoin proper, through CLI, scripting, and programming languages. However, there are many other utilities within the Bitcoin ecosystem: this chapter and the next cover what may be the biggest and most important: the Lightning Network. Here you'll begin work with the `lightning-cli` command-line interface, understanding a c-lightning setup and its features, including some examples and basic configuration.
