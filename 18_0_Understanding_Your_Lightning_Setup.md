# Chapter Eighteen: Understanding Your Lighting Setup

> :information_source: **NOTE:** This is a draft in progress, so that I can get some feedback from early reviewers. It is not yet ready for learning.

In this chapter you'll be ready to begin working with the `lightning-cli` command-line interface. But that first requires that you understand your c-lightning setup and its features, which is what will be explained with some examples and basic configuration.

For this and future chapters, we presume that you have a VPS with c-lightning installed, running `lightningd` courtersy of [Bitcoin Standup Scripts](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Bitcoin-Standup-Scripts) on Testnet.

## Objectives for This Chapter

After working through this chapter, a developer will be able to:

   * Demonstrate that their c-lightning Node is Installed and Up-to-date
   * Use basic wallet Commands
   * Setting up a channel.
   * Pay an invoice
   * Generate a payment request.
