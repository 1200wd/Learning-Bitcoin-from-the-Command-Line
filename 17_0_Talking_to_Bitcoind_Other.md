# Chapter 17: Talking to Bitcoind with Other Languages

You should now have a solid foundation for working with Bitocin in C, not only using RPC, JSON, and ZMQ libraries to directly interact with `bitcoind`, but also utilizing the Libwally libraries to complement that work. And C is a great language for prototyping and abstraction â€” but it's probably not what you're programming in. This chapter thus takes a whirlwind tour of six other programming languages, demonstrating the barest functionality for interacting with a wallet and sending a transaction in each, allowing you to expand the lessons of the command line and C to the programming language of your choice.

## Objectives for This Chapter

After working through this chapter, a developer will be able to:

   * Prepare Bitcoin Development Environments for a Variety of Languages
   * Use Wallet Functions in a Variety of Languages
   * Use Transaction Functions in a Variety of Languages
   
Supporting objectives include the ability to:

  * Understand More about RPC through Interactions with a Variety of Languages
