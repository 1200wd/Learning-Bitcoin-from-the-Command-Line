# 16.2: Using BIP32 in Libwally

> **NOTE:** This is a draft in progress, so that I can get some feedback from early reviewers. It is not yet ready for learning.

One of Libwally's greatest powers is that it can lay bare the underlying work of creating addresses. In particular, it supports [BIP32](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0032.mediawiki), which allows you to manipulate HD wallets, which are Hierarchical Deterministic Wallets, as described in [ยง3.5](03_5_Understanding_the_Descriptor.md).
